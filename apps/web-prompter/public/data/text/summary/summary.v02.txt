Eric Metaxas opened his talk on Socrates in the City by introducing his guest speaker, nanoscientist Dr. James Tour. Tour's research into nanoscience has revolutionary potential, from defeating viruses and diseases to strengthening building materials. He and Elizabeth Blakemore discussed his work in nanoribbons, which can potentially be used to heal humans and replace current electrical wires with fabrics with a million times the conductivity. Dr. Tour and George Gilder discussed the 1952 Miller-Urey experiment, wherein scientists attempted to create single-celled life from non-living matter, but have been met with only limited success. Steve Benner, another prominent researcher, argues that experts in the field still have no definition of what life is and the scientific consensus on how life can emerge has been challenged. Dr. Tour has spoken out on the topic of origin of life on YouTube despite pushback from those in power. He encourages further research, as he believes that the world needs to know the truth and that it is a big deal. Many have thanked him for bringing the truth to the public and he is determined to keep going despite resistance.
